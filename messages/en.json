    "q1": "What makes A7X different from other AI consultants?",
    "a1": "We prioritize Process Clarity before implementation. While most consultants jump straight to tools, we first map your entire operation, identify the highest-ROI opportunities, and create a clear automation roadmap. This approach ensures every automation delivers measurable results — not just technical novelty.",
    "q2": "How long does a typical engagement take?",
    "a2": "Our Discovery phase takes 1-2 weeks. Implementation typically takes 3-6 weeks depending on complexity. Most clients see initial results within the first month and full ROI within 3-6 months.",
    "q3": "What tools and platforms do you work with?",
    "a3": "We're platform-agnostic and use the best tool for each job: n8n, Make (Integromat), Zapier, custom Python scripts, OpenAI, Claude, and various API integrations. We also work with existing CRMs, ERPs, and business tools your team already uses.",
    "q4": "Do you work with businesses outside the US?",
    "a4": "Absolutely! We work with businesses globally. Our team operates across multiple time zones, and we provide services in English, Portuguese, and Spanish. Remote collaboration is at our core.",
    "q5": "What's included in the Free Process Assessment?",
    "a5": "A 30-minute strategy call where we analyze your top 3 business processes, identify quick automation wins, and provide a preliminary ROI estimate. No commitment required — it's designed to show you what's possible.",
    "q6": "What kind of ROI can I expect?",
    "a6": "Our clients typically see 150-400% ROI within the first year. The average is 240%. ROI comes from time savings, error reduction, faster processing, and enabling your team to focus on high-value work instead of manual tasks."
