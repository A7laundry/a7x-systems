    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about working with A7X Systems.",
    "q1": "What makes A7X different from other AI consultants?",
    "a1": "We prioritize Process Clarity before implementation. While most consultants jump straight to tools, we first map your entire operation, identify the highest-ROI opportunities, and create a clear automation roadmap. This approach ensures every automation delivers measurable results — not just technical novelty.",
    "q2": "How long does a typical engagement take?",
    "a2": "Our Discovery phase takes 1-2 weeks. Implementation typically takes 3-6 weeks depending on complexity. Most clients see initial results within the first month and full ROI within 3-6 months.",
    "q3": "What tools and platforms do you work with?",
    "a3": "We're platform-agnostic and use the best tool for each job: n8n, Make (Integromat), Zapier, custom Python scripts, OpenAI, Claude, and various API integrations. We also work with existing CRMs, ERPs, and business tools your team already uses.",
    "q4": "Do you work with businesses outside the US?",
    "a4": "Absolutely! We work with businesses globally. Our team operates across multiple time zones, and we provide services in English, Portuguese, and Spanish. Remote collaboration is at our core.",
    "q5": "What's included in the Free Process Assessment?",
    "a5": "A 30-minute strategy call where we analyze your top 3 business processes, identify quick automation wins, and provide a preliminary ROI estimate. No commitment required — it's designed to show you what's possible.",
    "q6": "What kind of ROI can I expect?",
    "a6": "Our clients typically see 150-400% ROI within the first year. The average is 240%. ROI comes from time savings, error reduction, faster processing, and enabling your team to focus on high-value work instead of manual tasks."

    "title": "Common Questions from Hosts",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about the Vacation Property Growth System.",
    "q1": "I already get enough bookings from Airbnb. Why do I need this?",
    "a1": "Getting bookings is one thing. Keeping 100% of the revenue is another. Platform fees eat 15-20% of every booking. Even if Airbnb fills your calendar, you're leaving $10K-$15K/year on the table per property. More importantly, you're building someone else's brand, not yours. A direct booking channel doesn't replace Airbnb — it reduces your dependency on it.",
    "q2": "How long before I see results?",
    "a2": "Your property website and SEO foundation are typically live within 2 weeks. Local SEO results start appearing in 60-90 days as Google indexes your property. Most hosts see their first direct booking inquiry within 30-60 days. Meaningful direct booking volume (20%+) typically develops over 6-12 months as SEO compounds and your guest database grows.",
    "q3": "Do I need to stop listing on Airbnb or VRBO?",
    "a3": "Absolutely not. This isn't about replacing platforms — it's about reducing dependency. Keep your Airbnb and VRBO listings active. The goal is to build a parallel direct channel so that over time, a growing percentage of your bookings come platform-fee-free. Think of it as diversifying your booking sources.",
    "q4": "What if I only have one property?",
    "a4": "The Starter plan is specifically designed for single-property hosts. Even one property can benefit from a direct booking channel. The system is modular — start with one property and scale to more if your portfolio grows. Many of our most successful clients started with a single listing.",
    "q5": "Can you guarantee a certain number of bookings?",
    "a5": "No, and anyone who does is lying. What we can guarantee is a professionally built direct booking infrastructure, proven SEO strategies, and monthly optimization. Your results depend on your market, property quality, pricing strategy, and seasonality. What we show you are real case studies from real properties in similar markets.",
    "q6": "What happens if I cancel?",
    "a6": "You keep your property website, all content, and your guest database — it's all yours. We don't hold your data hostage. The website hosting and active SEO management would stop, but the foundation we built continues to work. There are no cancellation fees or long-term commitments.",
    "q7": "Do you handle actual guest communication or property management?",
    "a7": "No. We are a marketing and digital infrastructure partner, not a property management company. We build the systems that bring guests to YOUR door — the website, SEO, booking funnel, and guest database. You (or your property manager) handle the guest experience. We handle the digital growth.",
    "q8": "How is this different from just building a website on Squarespace?",
    "a8": "A website alone doesn't generate bookings. Our system includes local SEO strategy, Google Business Profile optimization, tracking pixels for retargeting, a conversion-optimized booking funnel, guest database building, and monthly performance optimization. It's the difference between having a billboard in the desert and having a billboard on the highway with a GPS directing traffic to it."
